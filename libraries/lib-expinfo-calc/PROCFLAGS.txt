Trial processing flags are specified as a cell array containing zero or
more of the following character vectors:

- 'avgtrials' generates data averaged across trials.
- 'pertrial' generates per-trial data, indexed by trial.
- 'spantrials' generates data by concatenating or otherwise aggregating
    across trials.

- 'parallel' indicates that a multithreaded implementation should be
    used (if available). This requires the Parallel Computing Toolbox.

The trial processing switches affect the structure of the output data; this
is documented in TIMEWINLAGDATA.txt.

(This is the end of the file.)
