A time window and time lag analysis generates a results data structure with
the following fields:


Metadata fields:

"destchans" is a cell array with FT channel names for the set of putative
  destination channels being compared.
"srcchans" is a cell array with FT channel names for the set of putative
  source channels being compared.

"delaylist_ms" is a vector containing the time lags tested in milliseconds.

"windowlist_ms" is a vector containing timestamps in milliseconds
  specifying where the middle of each analysis time window is.
"windowsize_ms" is a scalar holding the duration of the analysis time windows.

"trialnums" is a vector containing trial numbers (arbitrary integer values
  used as labels for each trial).


Analysis results:


For each type of analysis, fields with a common prefix and varying suffixes
will exist.

These are all matrices. For both per-trial and aggregate data, these are
indexed by (destchan, srcchan, trialidx, winidx, lagidx). Aggregate data
has a trial dimension of size 1.

"FOOdata" contains the values of the variable being measured. These are
  often but not always averages. Some values may be NaN (if they failed
  the acceptance filter or otherwise couldn't be computed).
"FOOcount" contains the number of samples used to produce the averages in
  FOOdata.
"FOOvar" contains the variance of the sample values used to produce the
  averages in FOOdata.

The intention is that the "count" and "var" fields allow uncertainty to be
propagated through any downstream calculations performed on the "data" values.


Each method of iterating trials (per PROCFLAGS.txt) produces a FOO label
with a different suffix:

'avgtrials' produces "BARavg".
'pertrial' produces "BARtrials".
'spantrials' produces "BARconcat".


...So, "BARavgdata" would be the averaged-across-trials data values
associated with prefix "BAR", "BARavgvar" would be their variance, and so
forth.
