A peak detection structure for a time-and-lag analysis has the following
fields:


"destchans" is a cell array with FT channel names for the set of putative
  destination channels that were compared.
"srcchans" is a cell array with FT channel names for the set of putative
  source channels that were compared.

"windowlist_ms" is a vector containing timestamps in millseconds specifying
  where the middle of each analysis time window was.

"trialnums" is a vector containing trial numbers (arbitrary integer values
  used as labels for each trial).


The following fields are matrices indexed by
(destchan, srcchan, trialidx, winidx):

"peaklags" contains the lag time (in milliseconds) of the peak.
"peakamps" contains the (signed) data value at the peak location.
"peakcounts" contains the number of samples contributing to the peak.
"peakvars" contains the estimated variance of the peak amplitude.
