A peak detection structure for a time-and-lag analysis has the following
fields:


"destchans" is a cell array with FT channel names for the set of putative
  destination channels that were compared.
"srcchans" is a cell array with FT channel names for the set of putative
  source channels that were compared.

"windowlist_ms" is a vector containing timestamps in millseconds specifying
  where the middle of each analysis time window was.

"peaklags" is a matrix indexed by (destchan, srcchan, winidx) containing
  the lag time (in milliseconds) of the peak.
"peakamps" is a matrix indexed by (destchan, srcchan, winidx) containing
  the (signed) data value at the peak location.
